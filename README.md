# Courseworks in MLP course at The University of Edinburgh.
This is my Coursework 1 and 2 for Machine Learning Practical Course.

CW1: Investigation of how overfitting phenomenon occurs in various neural network model settings;investigate how does methods like dropout and weight decay alleviate this problem.

CW2: Analyze the vanishing gradient problem happened in deepCNN networks by monitoring gradient flows.Explore existing solutions to this problem including Batch-Normalization and Residual Connections, explain their theory and implement details in pytorch.
